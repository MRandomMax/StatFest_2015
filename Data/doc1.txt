Data\visualization is the blend of art and science, a skill of presenting data in a graphical format. The essences of data visualization are (1) neatness – information being clearly delivered; (2) abundance – present |as much information as possible without breaking the “neatness”; (3) hierarchy – layers of information that you want them to be delivered in an intended order. In this course, we will start with the fundamentals of data visualization and the key statistics that are helpful to achieve the aforementioned essences of data visualization. This course will rely on R, a free software programming language and a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. R is widely used by@statisticians and data miners|for data visualization, analysis and modeling.  The goal of the course is that: after the 8 weeks’ training, one will be able to use R efficiently and master processing and transforming data to a graphical format that presents the key, yet useful, information for interpretation, decision-making and further analysis and modeling. You will be able to have your own codebook to decipher any dataset.
